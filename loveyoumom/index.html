	Good morning Mom, here is my Mother's Day card for the year. I just want to say that I am extremely grateful for all the work and all the sacrifices you have made, the amount of freedom you allow me, and the genuine support and advice that you consistently you give me that has allowed me to grow to be the person I am today and achieve the things I have. You have been my rock for 19 years and you have always been a source of joy and strength when I needed it most. I love you Mom. Enjoy today!
