<h2>1. General
<a name="1. General"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generally, the EE booklet is
<b><i>not</i></b> written for STEM EEs. It is more well
suited for historical analysis or English EEs. This,
however, should not be discouraging since choosing a
slightly more obfuscated EE topic you are interested in
rather than one you are not motivated to complete will prove
to make the process much, much more enjoyable. You may be
reading this document after you have chosen a question, and
perhaps after you have been coupled with an advisor. If this
is the case, you should know:</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><b>It is not too
late to change your question!</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EE is usually blown off,
however, choosing a meaningful and interesting topic can not
only be fun, but incredibly rewarding. Generally, you should
be prioritizing your <i>learning</i> during your EE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lastly, even though this
document is separated into sections, this information can be
applied to any EE!</p>

<h2>2. Computer Science
<a name="2. Computer Science"></a>
</h2>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;To what
extent is Gaussian Elimination more efficient than the
Jacobi method at solving systems of linear equations with
diagonally dominant coefficient matrices of increasing size
in computer systems?&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was my question. It&rsquo;s
just comparing 2 different strategies of solving a
particular type of problem which occurs pretty often in
scientific computing, data analysis, and computer graphics.
Below are some issues and advice I have to offer:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="90%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Understand your question &amp;
read the textbook!</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time given to you to
&quot;explore&quot; your question is not nearly enough.
Multiple times during my exploration I had to question what
I actually knew and what my question actually &rdquo;Before
beginning &quot;research&quot; into your question, read
through textbooks (there exists numerous websites dedicated
to free textbooks, some of which are questionably legal) to
get an accurate outline of what your question actually
entails.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.</p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="64%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Draft your code and paper
early.</p> </td>
<td width="26%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although I didn&rsquo;t intend
for it, the bulk amount of my coding was done in the final
weeks of my project. Not only was this stressful during
college applications, I also had no time to reflect on the
results of my experiment and whether or not they made any
sense. Creating drafts early, preferably before the start of
the school year, prevents this from happening.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.</p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="80%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Organize before tackling and
reevaluate.</p> </td>
<td width="10%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Admitedly my paper was defintely
research intensive. Although I spent a lot of time reading
and researching, I gathered a large set of resources and
gained programming skills that will and have benefitted me
tremendously. And these aren&rsquo;t abstract skills like
&quot;leadership&quot; and &quot;organization&quot;, I use
the resources that I procured during this project everyday,
and the development of my programming skills and my
introduction to the coding community has put me well beyond
what any class at PA could&rsquo;ve provided for me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I believe that all students
planning on doing a Computer Science EE consult IBCSEEWorld
for a plethora of submitted CS EEs with grades.</p>

<h2>3. Biology
<a name="3. Biology"></a>
</h2>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;How
accurate is the synthetic rFC compared to the naturally
occurring LAL in endotoxin detection?&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was a comparative analysis
of 3 articles (experiments) so it is a little bit unusual,
but arguably easier to get into than a full blown biology
experiment. This makes it great for those who are
intimidated by doing an experiment by entirely by themselves
(excluding help from an advisor, of course) for the first
time.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t wait until the end
to do everything!</p></td>
<td width="6%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Self explanatory, you understand
the consequences!</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="88%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use JSTOR and take notes
<b>about</b> your sources!</p></td>
<td width="2%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This person reported that they
wasted a lot of time rereading sources because they forgot
about what they actually included. They also suggested using
JSTOR and utilizing specific sources (including quotes
(&quot;), time ranges, etc.). Chemistry</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="74%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read for understanding, not
verbatim.</p> </td>
<td width="16%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This person suggested reading
the introductions and conclusions of each article so that
they can form a more clear understanding of the experiment.
The middle of the paper often contains gobs of scientific
jargon and extra details that are likely to obscure the
relevant details of the paper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lastly, take it step by step!
Thinking about the paper in terms of individual goals will
make it much more manageable. This is a life skill that is
sure to benefit you no matter what you do in your life.</p>

<h2>4. Chemistry
<a name="4. Chemistry"></a>
</h2>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;How does
an increase in the number of carbon atoms in primary
alcohols affect the yield and purity of their respective
esters prepared using propanoic acid?&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an example of an
experimental science paper. Your advisor will help you a lot
with the overall design of the equipment. The school has a
variety of chemicals available and in some cases they will
be willing to purchase chemicals on your behalf.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

hardest parts of the whole paper!</p></td></tr>

<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="90%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocate more time than you
think you need for data collection, your first experiement
iteratiors will likely be used to work out kinks in the
process.</p> </td></tr>

<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">4</p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="90%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refer to Chemsitry IAs and the
Textbook for information and for what IB is expecting
regarding quantitative error analysis (like propagation of
uncertainties, IAs will often be a good source of this type
of analysis).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be noted that
investigating a complex topic is less important than your
thoroughness and critical reflection (ie. analyzing errors,
suggesting improvements, proposing original and meaningful
extensions, etc.).</p>

<h2>5. Technology in a Global Society
<a name="5. Technology in a Global Society"></a>
</h2>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;To what
extent is semantic search more effective, in terms of
finding information to meet one&rsquo;s needs, than keyword
search under the conditions of the countries with high,
moderate, and low censorship?&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This essay was composed of two
different parts: comparing the two searching algorithms as
well as examining the effect of governmental censorship on
the internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plan early!</p></td>
<td width="68%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like I discussed in my personal
Extended Essay, robust planning pays dividends. This person
found that they needed to find a dependable VPN to connect
to countries with high censorship as well as confounding
variables such as search engine choice, browser choice,
query selection, etc.</p>

<td width="90%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Understand the limitations of
your exploration.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This person found out that they
there was a number of flaws in their experiment including
language and cultural differences of each country. Since
there often isn&rsquo;t an easy solution to this problem,
they suggest identifying and explaining these limitations in
your paper.</p>

<h2>6. Math
<a name="6. Math"></a>
</h2>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;How is
the theory of elliptic curves used in the encryption and
decryption of data?&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This paper seems to be a more
exploratory paper rather than an experimental paper. IB
separates different disciplines, especially sciences, into
experimental and non-experimental. For math, they do not
require an &quot;experiment&quot;, but for computer science
they do. Mathematics papers are particularly good for those
who want to prioritize their learning because you can just
learn a sub branch of math and then talk about it in your
EE.</p>

<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="90%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write your rough draft early,
leave the EE alone for a few weeks, and then reread! This is
an especialy good piece of advice because it allows for peer
review during this time and a fresh outlook on the paper
when you return.</p></td></tr>

Bibguru.com. All of the other software provided to you,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Word Processing (making your
document look good): LATEX (pronounced Lay-Tek) is the
professional standard. It may look intimidating, especially
if you are not familiar with typesetting languages but it
will make formatting your document much easier. In addition,
it automatically adjusts you citations (automatically
switchs formats depending on style, removes citations not
inline cited from the end of paper references, etc.). You
can compile (process the documents) locally on your computer
but for people not familiar with type-setting software,
Overleaf is a great website to get you started. On there
they have a great written introduction to LATEX. As for
videos, Luke Smith has a great introduction however his
delivery can be seen as unprofessional.</p></td></tr>

use the following resources but they would&rsquo;ve been a
great help for any of my questions. IB has an Discord and a
