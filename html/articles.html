		<p>As per usual of a 17 year old, I have nothing important to say to the vast majority of people. With that being said, I may have some good advice for high schoolers wanting to go about the same path I have. 
		<ul>
			<li><a>linear algebra?</a>: By no means am I an expert at linear algebra, but I have done a lot of reading and I believe I can offer some good advice for where to look to self direct your own study. </li>
			<li><a>do what you want</a>: An opinion piece that basically says that you shouldn't shill for higher education, and instead focus your time on activities that are meaningful to you. 
		</ul>
