	<h1>Announcements Page</h1>
	<p>9/30/21<br>This is the first announcements of the website! The official name of this website is "Under Construction!". This is in reference to how I feel about myself as a person, and the state of the website, which I am sure will remain in a perpetual state of being not-developed-enough. This website will be a home for my projects and documentation thereof, my resume, and any short essays I decide to write. The future plans for this website in more specific terms include: My Extended Essay, a short blog on the challenges of learning Rust and Haskell, an exploration of the lawnmower problems, relevants resources including my email (which I hope to have the domain of my website) and github, and some pictures showing my "rehabilitation" of the trail behind my house. Thank you for reading and take care. - Ian
